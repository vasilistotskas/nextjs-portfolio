I've had a passion for computers and technology since an early age, spending countless hours exploring the intricacies of my PC. This curiosity led me to web development, where I now have three years of experience building applications and websites using technologies like Django (Python), Codeigniter (PHP), Vue2-3 (TypeScript, JavaScript), NestJs, SASS (CSS), MariaDB, and Postgres. Additionally, I have practical knowledge of DevOps, specifically with tools such as Docker."
